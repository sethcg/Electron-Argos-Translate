## Download models for development and building:

**Note**: Downloading all argos pre-trained translate models takes up around ~8.8 GB of disk space.

Optionally you can specify which language models to download for development/building by changing the download-models.js file script "select_languages_only" constant variable.

```bash

# Run download script
npm run download

```
